## :question: How to use
I wrote [a little article](https://dev.to/johannesjo/super-productivity-how-to-grow-fond-of-time-tracking-and-task-management-22ee) on how I use the app. There is also [a youtube video available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoF2_RSdNXA).

## :globe_with_meridians: Web Version
Check out the [web-version](http://super-productivity.com). It is a little bit more limited (time tracking only works if the app is open and idle time tracking is disabled).

If you want the Jira Integration to work you have also to download and install the [Super Productivity Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-productivity/ljkbjodfmekklcoibdnhahlaalhihmlb).

## :computer: Downloads & Install
### All Platforms
[Install from the releases page](https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity/releases).

### Windows
Due to certification issues it's recommended to download from the Microsoft Store:

<a href='//www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nhfvg8361tw?cid=storebadge&ocid=badge'><img src='https://assets.windowsphone.com/13484911-a6ab-4170-8b7e-795c1e8b4165/English_get_L_InvariantCulture_Default.png' alt='English badge' width="127" height="52"/></a>

### Linux
```
# stable
sudo snap install superproductivity

# edge channel releases
 sudo snap install --channel=beta superproductivity
```
<a href="https://snapcraft.io/superproductivity">
  <img alt="Get it from the Snap Store" src="https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg" />
</a>

### MacOS
Install via [homebrew cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) (project might not always be up to date):
```
brew cask install superProductivity
```

## Setup WebDAV Syncing
When starting the app via the command line the path to where emergency backups are saved is printed out to the command line. Just take away the `/backup` sub folder from the path and use the remaining path to sync via the cloud.

## :hearts: Contributing
There are several ways to help. Publishing a bug or a feature request is a good first step. Also making it more popular by posting it on social media etc. is great, because it means more users, which in turn leads to more people testing the app and also more people contributing code.

**Pull requests** are of course also very welcome. Please make sure that you're following the [angular commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits) and to also include the issue number in your commit message, if you're fixing a particular issue (e.g.: `feat: add nice feature with the number #31`).

### Running the development server
To run the development server you need to have node installed at least in the version 10. Go to https://nodejs.org for installation instructions.

**Clone repo**
```
git clone https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity.git
```
**Install dependencies**
```
cd super-productivity
npm install
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
**Run the dev server**
```
ng serve
```
Afterwards you can open http://localhost:4200 in your browser. For most adjustments this should be enough and also enables you to use the [redux dev tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=de). 

If you want to run the app standalone do the following:
```
ng serve

# in a new console tab
npm start
```

### Packaging the app
Packaging the app is done via [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder). To start packaging run `yarn dist`. If you want to add new platforms and experiment with the build options the easiest way to do so is manipulating the `build` property in the [package.json](https://github.com/johannesjo/super-productivity/blob/develop/package.json), but you can also use the [command line interface of electron builder](https://www.electron.build/cli).
