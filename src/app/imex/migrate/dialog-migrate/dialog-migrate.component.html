    <h2>Super Productivity V1 Data found</h2>
    <p>Do you want to migrate it? Please note that only projects and tasks are migrated, but not your project
      configuration.</p>
    <p>Please also note that the migration process might not be working as you would expect. There is probably a lot you
      need to tweak afterwards and it might even happen that the process fails completely, so making a backup of your
      data is highly recommended.</p>
