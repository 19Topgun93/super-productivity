    <p>Time for a little self evaluation! Your answers here are saved and provide you with a little bit of statistics on
      how you work in the <a routerLink="/metrics">metrics section</a>. Furthermore the suggestions for tomorrow will
      appear above your task list the next day.</p>

    <h3 class="mat-h3">Why should I care?</h3>
    <p>This is intended to be less about calculating exact metrics or becoming machine like efficient in all you do than
      it is about improving how you feel about your work. It can be helpful to evaluate pain points in your daily
      routine, as well as it is to find factors that help you out. Being just a little bit systematic about it hopefully
      helps to get a better grip on these and to improve what you can.</p>
