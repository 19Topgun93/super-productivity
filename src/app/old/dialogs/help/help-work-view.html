<h3 class="md-title">The work view</h3>
<p>This is the work view. It's meant to help you to keep track of what you have to do today and to enable you to easily track the time spent on different tasks.</p>
<p>The page is divided into a list for your undone tasks
  <ng-md-icon icon="playlist_play"></ng-md-icon>
  and a list of you done tasks
  <ng-md-icon icon="playlist_add_check"></ng-md-icon>
  below. Tasks can be moved via drag and drop between the lists.
</p>
<p>Once you are done working for the day you can go to the daily summary page by clicking the 'Finish your work day' button.</p>
