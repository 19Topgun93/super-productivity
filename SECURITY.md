# Security Policy
I am a web developer with a frontend focus and no security expert. I tried to follow the best practices as much as possible and I update electron often, but I can offer no guarantees. Help with this subject by more dedicated experts would be very much appreciated!


## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any vulnerabilities to contact@super-productivity.com. Ideally you also ping me here (e.g. by opening up an issue), so I know I might have to check my spam folder as well.
